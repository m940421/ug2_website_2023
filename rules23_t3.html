              Anyone can register for the competition through our CodaLabs <a href="https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/7988" target="_blank"><u>page</u></a> until it ends on May 1, 2023. Please also note that our registration process differs from the other tracks and does not require filling out a google form. 
              <h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Phases</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Training Phase:&nbsp;</strong>We provide a training set and validation set taken from&nbsp;<a href="http://visual.ee.ucla.edu/gt_rain.htm/" target="_parent">GT-RAIN</a>&nbsp;to use for development. In addition to the provided training set,&nbsp;<span>participants</span> may use any other dataset for training. However, <strong>the final training dataset is required to contain the training set of GT-RAIN.</strong> Please note that the validation set provided for this challenge is taken directly from a combination of the validation and the test set of GT-RAIN. A completely separate test set that has been collected for the purpose of this competition will be used to evaluate the final submissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Validation Phase:&nbsp;</strong>To ensure a smooth final submission, participants can optionally submit their results on the provided validation set to receive feedback where your latest submission will be displayed on the leaderboard. Note that the purpose of this is to act as a "dry-run" phase; results obtained on the validation set do not necessarily correspond with the final performance.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><strong>Testing Phase:&nbsp;</strong>Participants are asked to predict the derained output from a newly collected test set that will be released during this phase without the corresponding ground truth image. This dataset will contain 15 scenes of 300 frames all cropped to multiples of 4. Your final score will be computed from a combination of the standard PSNR and SSIM.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For submission format, please carefully follow the guidelines outlined in the Evaluation and Submission section on our CodaLabs competition <a href="https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/7988#learn_the_details-terms_and_conditions" target="_parent">page</a>. The organizers reserve the right to disqualify any participating team for any of the reasons mentioned above and if deemed necessary.</p>
