                <p style="text-align: justify;">UG<sup>2</sup> Prize Challenge evaluates algorithms for enhancement of images/videos at scale. The most successful and innovative teams will be invited to present at the CVPR 2018 workshop. We provide two challenge categories:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Image Enhancement to Facilitate Manual Inspection</li>
                  <li>Image Enhancement to Improve Automatic Object Recognition</li>
                </ol>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Each challenge will have:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>$25K awarded to the top scoring entry (including travel money to attend CVPR 2018)</li>
                  <li>$12.5K awarded to the runner up (including travel money to attend CVPR 2018)</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">For a total of $75K awarded in prizes.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">The submissions will be judged by a three person team based on the output of the algorithms submitted to each challenge. The Judges will select the winners based upon their assessment of the viability and operational usefulness of the technology, which will be driven by human and automatic assessment, as described in the Challenges section of this website. The three judges are: Walter J. Scheirer (Notre Dame), Adam Czajka (Notre Dame), and Christopher Boehnen (IARPA).</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Participants who have investigated several algorithms may submit up to 3 algorithms per challenge. Changes in algorithm parameters do not constitute a different method, all parameter tuning must be conducted using the dataset provided and any additional data the participants consider appropriate.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The algorithms designed for each challenge must be submitted as a docker container including everything needed to generate enhanced images for the evaluation of the algorithms. Only one docker container including all the algorithms developed by the team (up to 3 algorithms) needs to be submitted for each challenge (up to 2 containers submitted per team, one per each challenge). It is essential that the participants provide a valid URL containing the submission files.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The algorithms must enhance each image provided in a designated input folder, and save the enhanced versions under the same image name at a designated output folder. That is, an image input/0.jpg would be saved by the first algorithm proposed by the participants in output1/0.png</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the algorithm's URL, participants will need to specify:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Contact details and affiliation</li>
                  <li>List of contributors</li>
