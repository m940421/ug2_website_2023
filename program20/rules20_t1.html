              <p style="text-align: justify;">To submit your results to our leaderboard, follow these steps:</p>
              <ol style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>Download the training/validation datasets and the Development Kit (<a style="color: #337ab7; text-decoration: underline" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/scaffrey/eval_tools">DevKit</a> - Undergoing testing and to be finalized soon).</li>
                <li>Train or finetune your model and run your trained model on the validation set. You can use the DevKits to evaluate the validation performance.</li>
                <!-- <li>Please make sure that:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Your algorithms can take all images from the "/root/UG2/Sub_challenge1_1/input/" directory as input</li>
                    <li>
                      You output the results into "/root/UG2/Sub_challenge1_1/output/userid/output/submission_#/"" (# refers to the number of submission). For Challenge 2, the output will be a file that has the same prefix name to the input file and “.txt” as its postfix with several lines to denote the bounding box locations as its content as following: 
                      <ul><li>531 189 573 240</li> <li>269 193 284 206 </li></ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li> -->
                <!-- <li>Pack all your code into a docker, and make sure the organizers can run “/root/UG2/ Sub_challenge2_1/test_submission_#.sh” and can generate the output files with the provided algorithm based on the given input files. Also, a README file explaining how your algorithms work and how to change the running behavior of the algorithms are welcomed.</li> -->
                <li>We will use the two commands below to run your docker submission:
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>docker pull your_dockerhub_id/your_docker_name:tag</code></li>
                    <li><code>nvidia-docker run -ti -v $user_output_path:/predictions/ -v $user_input_path:/images/ --entrypoint /bin/bash your_dockerhub_id/your_docker_name:tag /run.sh /images /predictions</code></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Please pack your running scripts in ONE bash file named run.sh in the docker. We will only run the bash file in each docker, which should take input from given image path and output predictions in the given destination path. Please refer to your own data path (i.e. user_input_path1, user_label_path1 …) corresponding.</li>
                <li>Upload your dock to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> and submit your docker link to the corresponding sub challenge. Check your uploaded docker with the testing code provided in our DevKits to make sure that the uploaded docker can work correctly. Note that, the basic docker should inherit from our provided docker template, whose docker link will be provided in DevKits. The organizers will not guarantee to test with the dockers that are built from other templates.</li>
                <li>Each team may submit up to 3 algorithms per sub challenge. All submissions (per sub challenge) will be held within one single Docker container to be uploaded to Docker Hub. The Docker container will contain all dependencies and code required to perform the model’s operation and will execute the model(s) contained upon run.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Development Kit</h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The Development Kit consists of a Docker file containing the basic structure for the algorithm submission, as well as instructions on how to pull and run a supplemental quantitative classification module for the second challenge. The images, annotation, and lists specifying the training/validation sets for the challenge are provided separately, and can be obtained via: Google Drive.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Each team must submit one algorithm for each challenge they wish to participate in. Participants who have investigated several algorithms may submit up to 3 algorithms per challenge. All submissions (per challenge) will be held within one single Docker container to be uploaded to Docker Hub. The Docker container will container all dependencies and code required to perform the model’s operation and will execute the model(s) contained upon run.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The input images will be provided to the container at run time through Docker’s mounting option, as will the output folders for the model(s) to save their results. Each model must be run on all images contained within the input folder and must save the new images to their respective output folder locations, without any name changes or missing images.</p>

              <p>Read carefully the following guidelines before submitting. Methods not complying with the guidelines will be disqualified.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>We encourage participants to use the provided training and validation data for each task, as well as to make use of their own data or data from other sources for training. However the use any form of annotation or use of any of the provided benchmarks test sets for either supervised or unsupervised training is strictly forbidden.</li>

                <li>Participants who have investigated several algorithms may submit up to 3 algorithms per challenge. Only a single submission per participant can be the winner of a single sub-challenge. Changes in algorithm parameters do not constitute a different method, all parameter tuning must be conducted using the dataset provided and any additional data the participants consider appropriate.</li>

                <li>
                  If an algorithm is submitted that makes inefficient use of deep learning, we may not be able to process the entire test set due to time constraints. To avoid this possibility, we will place limits on per-image runtime.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Results can vary based on the GPU used. We noticed that results varied slightly across GPU models. We are restricting our evaluation to one model (TitanXP) and will encourage participants to use this model in their development.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Eligibility</h3>

It is the responsibility of the Developer to ensure that they are allowed to export their technology solution to the United States for the Live Test.  Additionally, it is the responsibility of participants to ensure that no US law export control restrictions would prevent them from participating when foreign nationals are involved.  If there are US export control concerns, please contact the organizers and we will attempt to make reasonable accommodations if possible.</p></li>
