                  We encourage participants to use the provided training and validation data for each task, as well as to make use of their own data or data from other sources for training.
                  <b>However the use any form of annotation or use of any of the provided benchmarks test sets for either supervised or unsupervised training is strictly forbidden</b>.
                </li>

                  <b>Team name of submissions on Codalab must match the registration information. Any submission with a team name not registered will not be qualified for prizes.</b>
                  Only a single submission per team can be the winner of a single sub-track of this sub-challenge. Changes in algorithm parameters do not constitute a different method,
                  all parameter tuning must be conducted using the dataset provided and any additional data the participants consider appropriate.
                </li>
                <!-- <li>
                  If an algorithm is submitted that makes inefficient use of deep learning, we may not be able to process the entire test set due to time constraints.
                  To avoid this possibility, we will place limits on per-image runtime.
                </li> -->
                <!-- <li>
                  Results can vary based on the GPU used. We noticed that results varied slightly across GPU models. We are restricting our evaluation to one model (TitanXP) and will encourage participants to use this model in their development.
