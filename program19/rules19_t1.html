              <p style="text-align: justify;">For your submission, follow these steps:</p>
              <ol style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>Download the <a href='dataset19_t1.html' style="color: #337ab7; text-decoration: underline">training datasets</a> and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Lk1-mTIlyUTwp70OtatItDcPn6Q4NiRcokoylmqGIV8" style="color: #337ab7; text-decoration: underline">Development Kit</a>.</li>
                <li>Develop your solution and evaluate it on the validation sets (the evaluation code will be provided in the Development Kit).</li>
                <li>Please make sure that:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Your algorithms can take all images from the "home/input/" directory as input</li>
                    <li>You output the results into "home/output/alg#/" (# refers to the number of the algorithm submission[0-2]). Make sure that the input file names are preserved (that is, img0.png should be processed by your algorithm and saved as img0.png in the output folder for your algorithm).</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Pack all your code into the singularity container (see the Devkit README for more information on this), and make sure the organizers can run it and can generate the output files with the provided algorithm based on the given input files. Also, a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Lk1-mTIlyUTwp70OtatItDcPn6Q4NiRcokoylmqGIV8" style="color: #337ab7; text-decoration: underline">README file</a> explaining how your algorithms work and how to change the running behavior of the algorithms are welcomed.</li>
                <li>Upload your compiled Singularity image to Google Drive (or any cloud service) and submit your link to the corresponding sub-challenge. Note that, your Singularity container should inherit from our provided Singularity recipe template. The organizers will not guarantee to test with the dockers that are built from other recipe files.</li>
                <li>Each team may submit up to 3 algorithms per sub challenge. All submissions (per sub challenge) will be held within one single Singularity image. The Singularity image will contain all dependencies and code required to perform the model’s operation and will execute the model(s) contained upon run.</li>

              <p>Read carefully the following guidelines before submitting. Methods not complying with the guidelines will be disqualified.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Participants are expected to develop robust solutions to improve the visual task of a given sub-challenge, thus it is not allowed to tailor different methods or to alter the parameters of a method for any individual benchmark dataset (or subset of any of the datasets). A submission whose method is trained separately on a subset of a benchmark, resulting in different parameters/weights for any other subset or dataset of a given sub-challenge, or that employs a classifier to identify a given input benchmark or subset will be considered invalid. Moreover, a method who makes use of the knowledge of some labels corresponding to any specific benchmark, or that executes separate program paths designed specifically for individual datasets will also be considered in violation of these guidelines.</li>

                <li>We encourage participants to use the provided training and validation data for each task, as well as to make use of their own data or data from other sources for training. However the use any form of annotation or use of any of the provided benchmarks test sets for either supervised or unsupervised training is strictly forbidden.</li>

                <li>Participants who have investigated several algorithms may submit up to 3 algorithms per challenge. Only a single submission per participant can be the winner of a single sub-challenge. Changes in algorithm parameters do not constitute a different method, all parameter tuning must be conducted using the dataset provided and any additional data the participants consider appropriate.</li>

                <li>The algorithms designed must process each image or sequence of images (for sub-challenges centered in video enhancement) provided in a designated input folder, and save the enhanced versions under the same image name at a designated output folder. That is, an image input/0.jpg would be saved by the first algorithm proposed by the participants in output1/0.png.</li>
                <li>
                  If an algorithm is submitted that makes inefficient use of deep learning, we may not be able to process the entire test set due to time constraints. To avoid this possibility, we will place limits on per-image runtime.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Results can vary based on the GPU used. We noticed that results varied slightly across GPU models. We are restricting our evaluation to one model (TitanXP) and will encourage participants to use this model in their development.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Eligibility</h3>

It is the responsibility of the Developer to ensure that they are allowed to export their technology solution to the United States for the Live Test.  Additionally, it is the responsibility of participants to ensure that no US law export control restrictions would prevent them from participating when foreign nationals are involved.  If there are US export control concerns, please contact the organizers and we will attempt to make reasonable accommodations if possible.</p></li>
