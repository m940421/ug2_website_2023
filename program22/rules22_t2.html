              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Submission format (before winner validation): A zipfile containing a single <i>"arid_pred.csv"</i> file. A more detailed description could be found at the following codalab pages under "Participate -- Submit/View Results"</li>
                <li>
                  Codalab pages: <a style="color: #337ab7; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/1112">Codalab Link</a>

                </li>
                <li>After creating an account or logging into an existing account, please go to the <strong>User Settings</strong> by clicking on your icon on the top right corner. Then in the <strong>"Competition settings"</strong> section, fill in the <strong>"Team name"</strong> with your Team Name as registered in the Registration Form.</li>
                <li>If you have forgotten your Team Name, please contact us through email. The Team Name <strong>MUST</strong> be shown in the "Results" tab to be accounted for prize winning.</li>
                <li>The "Team Name" in the Submission page should also match the Team Name as registered in the Registration Form.</li>
                <li>Test videos: downloadable April 30 (GMT+0 00:00) ~ May 1 (GMT+0 00:00).</li>
                <li>The limited number of submissions will be enforced at the team level. That means, no matter how many team members are in your team, each TEAM (as shown in the "Team Name" field) can only submit 5 times. Submissions of a team may come from different members, but only the (chronologically) first 5 submissions from that TEAM will be considered on the leaderboard.</li>
                <!-- <li>Teams with Top-5 on the final testing Codalab leaderboard would go through a winner validation and confirmation process, <b>Details would be provided at a later date.</b></li> -->

              <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Teams with Top-5 on the final testing Codalab leaderboard would be required to submit their code for the winner validation and confirmation process. Please follow the instructions below carefully to ensure smooth confirmation process of your results:</b></p>
              <ol style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>Download the training/validation/testing datasets. The testing dataset would be available for download on April 30 (GMT+0, 00:00).</li>
                <li>Train or finetune your model. For obtaining the final testing result, run your trained model on the testing set.</li>
                <li>Pack your code into <b>one single .zip file</b>. By default we would be using raw video as the input to your code. If your algorithm requires the use of individual video frame or other pre-processing algorithms, include you frame extraction or pre-processing code as well in the zip file.</li>
                <li>Include a detailed instruction of the placement of the training, validation and testing data (i.e. where to place the data to enable training and testing).</li>
                <li>You should contain at most three running scripts, one for data pre-processing (named <code>run_preproc.sh</code>), one for training (named <code>run_train.sh</code>) and one for testing (inference) (named <code>run_test.sh</code>). We will <b>ONLY</b> run the three scripts during the validation process.</li>
                <li>Including the trained weight of your algorithm that could lead to the result shown in the leaderboard is highly recommended.</li>
                <li>Each team must only submit <b>ONLY ONE</b> zip file with <b>ONLY ONE SET</b> of algorithm corresponding to the submission result in the testing leaderboard. The zip file should contain all dependencies and code required to perform the algorithm's operation.</li>
                <li>Additional data (i.e., all data not included in the training and testing set provided by UG2 2022) must also be included. For easy download and ensure success submission of the zip files, you may upload the additional data to a cloud server (i.e. Gdrive, Onedrive, Dropbox, or Baidu Netdisk) and include the shared link in your README within your submitted zip file. You should also include the detailed instructions on how to leverage on the additional data provided. If you leverage public datasets, you should include the download site of the data directly in the README with detailed instructions on how you download and use the public datasets. This is to enable us to reproduce your training as much as possible.</li>
                <li><b>NOTE: </b>This validation process is <b>MANDATORY</b> for your results to be validated and counted towards the leaderboard and prizes. The goal is to ensure that the restrictions on data usage are NOT VIOLATED. The results reproduced by use <b>DOES NOT</b> serves as the end result as long as the restrictions are not violated and the reproduced results falls at a reasonable range towards the CODALAB results.</li>
              </ol>

              <h3 class="work-details-title font-alt">Running with NVIDIA Container Toolkit (nvidia-docker)</h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">To ensure a smooth validation and confirmation process, we <b>strongly recommend</b> participants to run or verify their code with Docker and NVIDIA Container Toolkit (nvidia-docker). Here we provide detailed instructions to install and run nvidia-docker.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Install NVIDIA GPU Driver using <b>.run</b> file. To ensure that you could run the required docker image, please install the GPU Driver with version <b>>= 440.33</b>.</li>
                <li>For the convenience of all participants, you may run the script provided <a style="color: #337ab7; text-decoration: underline" href="assets/files/install_nvidia_docker2_update.sh" target="_blank">here</a>. Alternatively, follow the following steps.</li>
                <li>Install docker and nvidia-docker following the instructions provided by NVIDIA <a style="color: #337ab7; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html">here</a>. You may also choose to install older docker version following the instructions provided by Docker <a style="color: #337ab7; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">here</a>.</li>
                <li>Our default docker image is pulled from NVIDIA NGC Catelog, the details of the docker is provided below. Follow the following two steps to pull and run the default docker image (also provided <a style="color: #337ab7; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:pytorch">here</a> or <a style="color: #337ab7; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:tensorflow">here</a>):
                  <br/>Using Pytorch:
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:21.06-py3</code></li>
                    <li><code>docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v {local_dir}:{container_dir} nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:21.06-py3</code> (Docker >= 19.03)</li>
                    <li><code>nvidia-docker run -it --rm -v {local_dir}:{container_dir} nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:21.06-py3</code> (Docker <= 19.02)</li>
                  </ul>
                  Using TensorFlow2:
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:21.06-tf2-py3</code></li>
                    <li><code>docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v {local_dir}:{container_dir} nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:21.06-tf2-py3</code> (Docker >= 19.03)</li>
                    <li><code>nvidia-docker run -it --rm -v {local_dir}:{container_dir} nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:21.06-tf2-py3</code> (Docker <= 19.02)</li>
                  </ul>
                  Using TensorFlow1:
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:21.06-tf1-py3</code></li>
                    <li><code>docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v {local_dir}:{container_dir} nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:21.06-tf1-py3</code> (Docker >= 19.03)</li>
                    <li><code>nvidia-docker run -it --rm -v {local_dir}:{container_dir} nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:21.06-tf1-py3</code> (Docker <= 19.02)</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Verify your algorithm using the running docker container. For more information on running docker containers, you may refer to the documentation <a style="color: #337ab7; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/">here</a>.</li>
              </ol>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The use of Docker and nvidia-docker is <b>NOT</b> mandatory, but we would use the above docker images during the validation and confirmation process to ensure fair comparison between algorithms.</p>
